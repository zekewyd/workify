# Employee Management Website
Employee Management Website with authentication, roles (Employee, HR, Admin), and workflows. The dashboard allows HR to monitor employee tasks, salaries, and payment history. Employees can add tasks, track hours, and view their salary history. Admins can manage users, assign HR roles, and approve payments. The project uses JWT for role-based access, integrates a payment gateway, and ensures responsiveness across devices.
